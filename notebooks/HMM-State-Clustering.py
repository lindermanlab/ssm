# # HMM State Clustering
# In this notebook we'll explore a post-hoc method for clustering HMM states.
# The idea is, given an HMM which has been fit to data, we reduce the number of states hierarchically by merging pairs of states. Let's say we start with an HMM with K states. The idea is that we'll try merging every pair of states and see which merge makes the log-likelihood of the data go down the least. Once we find that pair, we have K-1 states, and we repeat this process until we have satisfactorily few states.
#
# **Note**: This notebook is a little rough around the edges.

# # Cluster states from the original HMM
#
# The `merge_two_states` function below takes in a trained HMM, and indices of two states, s1 and s2. It outputs a new HMM where all states except for s1 and s2 are the same, along with the log-likelihood of the data under the new model.
#
# Here's how we merge two states: In the E-step of the EM algorithm, we obtain a T x K table, which has the probability of being in state K at time T for every time point. To merge state k1 and k2, we take the two columns of the table corresponding to these two states and sum them. From this, we get a new table which is K-1 x T. We then run an M-step as normal to get the best parameters for our new K-1 state model, and evaluate the log likelihood.
#
# **NOTE**: as written, the below function does not support inputs or masks, and it is limited to HMMs with stationary transitions.

# These merges are perhaps a little counterintuitive at first.  In terms of likelihood drop, the first two states to be merged woudl be red (1) and yellow (2).  Their means more fairly different than those of purple and orange, but they have relatively large variance.  Let's see what happens when we do this recursively.

# ## Hierarchical clustering by iteratively merging states
# We start with a K state HMM, then merge possible pair of states k1 and k2. We can see which are the best two states to merge by checking the new log-likelihood. We then rinse and repeat for our new K-1 state HMM, tracking the log-likelihood as we go, until there is only 1 state left. After each merge, we can show the observation distribution and new similarity matrix.
