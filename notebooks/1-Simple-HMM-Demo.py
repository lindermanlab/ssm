# A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is one of the simpler graphical models available in _SSM_. This notebook demonstrates creating and sampling from and HMM using SSM, and fitting an HMM to synthetic data. A full treatment of HMMs is beyond the scope of this notebook, but there are many good resources. [Stanford's CS228 Lecture Notes](https://ermongroup.github.io/cs228-notes/) provide a good introduction to HMMs and other graphical models. [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf) by Christopher Bishop covers HMMs and how the EM algorithm is used to fit them from data.
#   
#   
# The goal of these notebooks is to introduce state-space models to practitioners who have some familiarity with them, but who may not have used these models in practice before. As such, we've included a few exercises to try as you make your way through the notebooks.

# ## 2. Create an HMM
# An HMM consists of a set of hidden state variable, $z$, which can take on one of $K$ values (for our purposes, HMMs will always have discrete states), along with a set of transition probabilities for how the hidden state evolves over time. 
# In other words, we have $z_t \in \{1, \ldots, K\}$, where $z_t = k$ denotes that the hidden variable is in state $k$ at time $t$.
#
#
# The key assumption in an HMM is that only the most recent state affects the next state. In mathematical terms:
#
# $$
# p(z_t \mid z_{t-1}, z_{t-2}, \ldots, z_1) = p(z_t \mid z_{t-1})
# $$
#
# In an HMM, we don't observe the state itself. Instead, we get a noisy observation of the state at each time step according to some observation model. We'll use $x_t$ to denote the observation at time step $t$. The observation can be a vector or scalar. We'll use $D$ to refer to the dimensionality of the observation. A few of the supported observation models are:
#
# 1. **Gaussian**: Each discrete state $z_t = k$ is associated with a $D$-dimensional mean $\mu_k$ and covariance matrix $\Sigma_k$. Each observation $z_t$ comes from a Gaussian distribution centered at the associated mean, with the corresponding covariance.
#
# 2. **Student's T**: Same as Gaussian, but the observations come from a Student's-T Distribution.
#
# 3. **Bernoulli**: Each element of the $D$-dimensional observation is a Bernoulli (binary) random variable. Each discrete state $Z_i$ determines the probability that each element in the observation is nonzero.
#
# _Note: SSM supports many other observation models for HMMs. We are in the process of creating full-standalone documentation to describe them. For now, the best way to learn about SSM's other functionality is look at the source code. The observation models are described in observations.py._
#
#
# In the below example, we create an instance of the HMM with 5 discrete states and 2 dimensional observations. We store our HMM instance in a variable called true_hmm with this line:
#
# `
# true_hmm = ssm.HMM(K, D, observations="gaussian")
# `
#
# We then manually set the means for each latent state to make them farther away (this makes them easier to visualize).
#
# `
# true_hmm.observations.mus = 3 * np.column_stack((np.cos(thetas), np.sin(thetas)))
# `
#
# Here we are modifying the `observations` instance associated with the HMM we created above. We could also change the covariance, but for now we're leaving it with the default (identity covariance).

# ## 3. Sample from the HMM
#
# We draw samples from an HMM using the `sample` method:  
# `true_states, obs = true_hmm.sample(time_bins)`.  
#
# This returns a tuple $(z, x)$ of the latent states and observations, respectively.
# In this case, `true_states` will be an array of size $(200,)$ because it contains the discrete state $z_t$ across $200$ time-bins. `obs` will be an array of size $(200, 2)$ because it contains the observations across $200$ time bins, and each observation is two dimensional.
# We have specified the number of time-steps by passing `time_bins` as the argument to the `sample` method.
#
# In the next line, we retrieve the log-likelihood of the data we observed:  
# `true_ll = true_hmm.log_probability(obs)`  
#
# This tells us the relative probability of our observations. In the next section, when we fit an HMM to the data we generated, the true log-likelihood will be helpful for determining if our fitting algorithm succeeded.

# Try changing the observation model to Bernoulli and visualizing the sampled data. You'll need to create a new HMM object with Bernoulli observations.

# # 4. Fit an HMM to synthetic data
# This is all fine, but so far we haven't done anything that useful. It's far more interesting to learn an HMM from data. In the following cells, we'll use the synthetic data we generated above to fit an HMM from scratch. This is done in the following lines:
#
# `
# hmm = ssm.HMM(num_states, obs_dim, observations="gaussian")
# hmm_lls = hmm.fit(obs, method="em", num_em_iters=N_iters)
# `
#
# In the first line, we create a new HMM instance called `hmm` with a gaussian observation model, as in the previous case. Because we haven't specified anything, the transition probabilities and observation means will be randomly initialized. In the next line, we use the `fit` method to learn the transition probabilities and observation means from data. We set the method to `em` (expectation maximization) and specify the maximum number of iterations which will be used to fit the data. The `fit` method returns a numpy array which shows the log-likelihood of the data over time. We then plot this and see that the EM algorithm quickly converges.

# The below cell is a bit subtle. In the first section, we sampled from the HMM and stored the resulting latent state $z$ in a variable called `state`. 
# Now, we are treating our observations from the previous section as data, and seeing whether we can infer the true state given only the observations. However, there is no guarantee that the states we learn correspond to the original states from the true HMM. In order to account for this, we need to find a permutation of the states of our new HMM so that they align with the states of the true HMM from the prior section. This is done in the following two lines:
#
# `most_likely_states = hmm.most_likely_states(obs)
# hmm.permute(find_permutation(true_states, most_likely_states))
# `  
#   
# In the first line, we use the `most_likely_states` method to infer the most likely latent states given the observations.  In the second line we call the `find_permutation` function the permutation that best matches the true state. We then use the `permute` method on our `hmm` instance to permute its states accordingly.

# An HMM can also be used to smooth data (once its parameters are learned) but computing the mean observation under the posterior distribution of latent states. 
# Let's say, for example, that during time steps 0 to 10 the model estimates a 0.3 probability of being in state 1, and a 0.7 probability of being in state 2, given the observations $x$.
